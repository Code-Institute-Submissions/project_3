# EDMusic
 
## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
This page was created as a coding project in 2018! It was made to help people find EDM music. It is for:
1. Artists to get there name out in the world
2. People looking for small (or big) parties, or to throw parties
3. Artists to meet people and connect with their crowd

It is also a place for people who know nothing or a lot about EDM to find new genres and artists that go along with them!

### How does it work
